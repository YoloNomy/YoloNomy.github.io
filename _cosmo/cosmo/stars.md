By trying to answer the vast question "what is a star?", we will apply most of the things we have learn in our physics class in an exciting context.

# Stars: formation and structure

## The birth: Jean's parameters

$-V\geq E_T$

$$\frac{GM^2}{R} \geq k_B T \frac{M}{\mu}$$

By using $\rho = M/V$ and $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$.

$$M \geq M_{J}$$

$$M_J \propto \left(\frac{T}{\mu}\right)^{3/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}$$

  <summary>Proof</summary>

Starting from the inequality 

$$\frac{GM^2}{R} \geq k_B T \frac{M}{\mu}$$

We can simply isolate $M$ as

$$M^2 \geq R k_B T \frac{M}{G\mu}$$

$$M \geq \frac{R k_B T}{G\mu}$$

Now consider the density 

$$ \rho = \frac{M}{V}= \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3}$$  

such that the radius is

$$ 1/R^3 = \frac{4 \pi \rho}{3M} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4 \pi \rho}\right)^{1/3} $$

Puting this in the above equation on $M$, we have

$$M \geq \frac{(3M)^{1/3} k_B T}{(4\pi \rho)^{1/3}G\mu}$$

$$M^{2/3} \geq \frac{(3)^{1/3} k_B T}{(4\pi \rho)^{1/3}G\mu}$$

$$M \geq \left(\frac{(3)^{1/3} k_B T}{(4\pi \rho)^{1/3}G\mu}\right)^{3/2}$$

$$ M\geq \frac{(3)^{1/2} (k_B T)^{3/2}}{(4\pi \rho)^{1/2}(G\mu)^{3/2}}$$

$$ M\geq \frac{\sqrt{3}k_B^{3/2}}{\sqrt{4\pi}G^{3/2}} \left(\frac{T}{\mu}\right)^{3/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}=M_J$$
