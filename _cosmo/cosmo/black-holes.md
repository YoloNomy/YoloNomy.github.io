# The idea of black-holes

The idea of black holes is already hidden in Newtonian mechanics as we discussed in our page on energy. 

$r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$


# General relativity

As Wheeler famously put it "Matter tells space time how to curve, space-time tells matter how to move."

### Matter tells space time how to curve 

# The Einstein equation

In general relativity, our best theory of gravitation, the gravitational force is understood as motion in a curved space-time. The geometry of space time is fully described by the metric field $g_{\mu\nu}$, allowing to describe length through the generalized pythagorian theorem :

$$ ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$$

Solution to the Einstein equation

$$R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu \nu}$$

The connexion $\Gamma$.

# The Schwarzchild metric

The gravitational field around a spherical mass is given by the Schwarzchild metric, discovered by Karl Schwarzchild in 1916, while he was fighting in the trenches of WWI.

$$  ds^2 = -\left( 1 -\frac{r_s}{r} \right)c^2dt^2 + \left( 1 -\frac{r_s}{r} \right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + sin^2\theta d\phi^2) $$

with the Schwarzshild radius
$ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$

Singularity

No hair theorem. (rotating + charged black holes).

### Space-time tells matter how to move 

# Geodesic equations

Particles are moving on geodesics : paths of smallest length, in the curved space-time.
