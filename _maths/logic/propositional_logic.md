# Propositional logic

## Propositions

The simplest elements of logic are called **propositions**. They are objects, which we will note $p,q,r,...$ which can take only two possible values, noted either 'True' (T) or 'False' (F), $0$ and $1$ or 'yes' and 'no'. This value is called the **truth value** of the proposition. In standard propositional logic, one consider that truth values are **mutually exclusive** that is $p$ can be either true or false, but not both or neither.

Logic takes its origin in philosophy, where it is mostly concerned about the structure of reasoning and the validity of some inferences. In this context, propositions could be sentences as $p =$"The book is blue". $p$ can thus be either true or false. The goal of logic will not be to estimate wether $p$ is, in fact, true or false but instead to see how to combine sentences such as $p$ with other propositions in order to build more complicated structures. One would then study the consequence of the truness or falsness of $p$ on the whole network of propositions in which it is embedded and study wether logical arguments containing $p$ can be considered as valid, or not (if this seems very abstract, we will try to illustrate it better later on). 

Mathematics and informatics built on the philosopher's logic to build the fundations of their discipline. In this context, a proposition which can take only two values $0/1$ or 'yes'/'no', represents a minimal amount of information (a bit). By connecting together such minimal structures, one can construct much complex objects, such as sets and numbers for mathematics and computers for informatics!
