### The idea of black-holes

"black stars"

$$ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{R} $$

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

What if $v \geq c$?


### The Schwarzchild metric

In general relativity, our best theory of gravitation, the gravitational force is understood as motion in a curved space-time. The geometry of space time is fully described by the metric field $g_{\mu\nu}$, allowing to describe length.

Solution to the Einstein equation

$R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu \nu}$

The gravitational field around a spherical mass is given by the Schwarzchild metric.
