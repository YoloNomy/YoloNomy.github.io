### The idea of black-holes

The idea of black holes is already hidden in Newtonian mechanics. 

Indeed, imagine you are in a starship of mass $m$, on the surface of a planet of mass $M$ and radius $R$. If you want to leave the planet, you will have to go fast enough to escape gravity. To do so, you will need a kinetic energy $T$ that is large enough to compensate the gravitational potential energy $V$ of the planet. That is $ T \geq V  $.
Using the corresponding mathematical expressions, you have the condition:

$$ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \geq \frac{GMm}{R}  $$

The minimal speed satisfying this is condition $v_e$, is called the escape velocity

$$ v_l = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

On earth it is $\sim 11$ km/s and this is the speed at which rockets are launched in space.

Now, a natural question arise: what if $v \geq c$, that is, what if light itself could not be fast enough to escape the gravity of the planet?

The french astronomer Pierre-Simon de Laplace asked himself this question in 1796.

### The Schwarzchild metric

In general relativity, our best theory of gravitation, the gravitational force is understood as motion in a curved space-time. The geometry of space time is fully described by the metric field $g_{\mu\nu}$, allowing to describe length through the generalized pythagorian theorem :

$$ ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$$


Solution to the Einstein equation

$$R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu \nu}$$

The gravitational field around a spherical mass is given by the Schwarzchild metric, discovered by Karl Schwarzchild in 1916, while he was fighting in the trenches of WWI.
