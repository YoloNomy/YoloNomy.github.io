## Defining equilibrium

A system is said to be at thermal equilibrium with another if they do not exchange [heat](../firstprinciple), that is $\delta Q=0$.

As such, a system which is described by a single temperature $T$ is by definition at thermal equilibrium with itself that is each "subpart" of it is at equilbrium with another.

## The principle zero of thermodynamics

What is sometimes considered as the zeroth principle of thermodynamics states that thermal equilbrium is **contagious**, or more formally **transitive**. 

That is: consider three systems $A$, $B$ and $C$. If $A$ is in thermal equilibrium with $B$ and $A$ is in thermal equilibrium with $C$, then $B$ is in thermal equilibrium with $C$.

Often considered as a consequence of a combination of the first and the second principle (we'll rediscuss this later).

## Temperature

Temperature is a state variable that is not like the others. If it is the same between two systems, both are necessarily in thermal equilibrium between one another.
