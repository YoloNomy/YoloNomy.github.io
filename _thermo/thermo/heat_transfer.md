How long does it take to cool a cup of coffee?
In this class, we never explicitely talked about time dependence of the quantities, or space-dependence of them. However, this seems like a natural question to ask. 

How to go from one equilibrium state to another?

Make a more realistic describtion of the phenomenon described in our [introduction to derivatives](../calculus.md).

$$\boxed{\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =  \frac{\lambda}{\rho c_p} \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}}$$
