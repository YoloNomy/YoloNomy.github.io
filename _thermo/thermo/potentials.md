We already encountered **state functions**, that is functions describing the system and expressed in terms of states variables. Each of the two first principle of thermodynamics introduces a state function and describe its evolution through transformations, namely the **internal energy** $U(P,V,T,N)$ and the **entropy** $S(P,V,T,N)$

## Thermodynamics potentials:

**Helmmholtz free energy**:

$$ A = U - TS$$

**Enthalpy**:

$$ H = U + PV$$

**Gibbs free energy**

$$U + pV - TS$$

## Analogy with mechanics:
