# Thermodynamics: why should you care?

# Studying a system

## State variables and state functions

We call a *system* any general object of study in thermodynamics. It could be a box of gas, a star, a thermal engine ...
What will interest us is how this system evolves and possibly interact with what surrounds it. The surrounding of a system is called the *exterior*.

In classical thermodynamics, a system is caracterized by the following mesurable quantities called *state variables*: 
- The *pressure* $P$
- The *temperature* $T$
- The *quantity of matter* $n$ or the number of particles $N=nN_A$.
- The *volume* $V$.

From the state variables it is possible to create functions, called *state functions*.

## Equation of state

The equation you will see over and over again, called the ideal gas equation, relates all the state variables of the system as

$$ PV = n\mathcal{R}T $$
