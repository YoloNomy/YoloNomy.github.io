# Thermodynamics: why should you care?

# Studying a system

## State variables and state functions

We designate by *system* a general object of study in thermodynamics. It could be a box of gas, a star, a thermal engine ...
What will interest us is how this system evolves and possibly interact with what surrounds it. The surrounding of a system is called the *exterior*.

In classical thermodynamics, a system is caracterized by the following mesurable quantities called *state variables*: 
- The *pressure* $P$
- The *temperature* $T$
- The *quantity of matter* $n$ or the number of particles $N$.
- The *volume* $V$.

From the state variables it is possible to create functions, called *state functions*.
