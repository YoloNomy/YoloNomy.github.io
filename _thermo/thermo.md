You will find here some fun python applications to physics with some detailled explanations. All codes are stored in [this repository](https://github.com/YoloNomy).

# Thermodynamics

- [Studying a system](../thermo/system/)
- First law of thermodynamics: energy
- [The ideal gas](../thermo/idealgas/)
- Van der Waals gas
- Studying change: derivative and integrals
- Second law of thermodynamics: entropy


# Statistical physics


- Maximizing the entropy
- The ideal gas, part II
- Grand ensemble and more
- Quantum statistics: fermions and bosons
- The blackbody radiation
- [Notes of statistical physics](../statistical/stat/) (notes covering the plan above, to be included later in proper lectures)
