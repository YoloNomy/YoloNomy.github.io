# The three principles of thermodynamics in a statistical context

With all the machinery of statistical physics, it becomes possible to prove, or further justify the three principles of classical thermodynamics

## A remark: the conservation of information?

### Putting back units

So far, we implicitely assumed $k_B = 1$. 

$$k_B = 1.3806490\times 10^{-23} $$ J/K

allows to translate temperature into energy through:
$$E_{th} \propto k_B T$$

And also allows to associate units to entropy,

$$S_{\rm th}  = k_B S$$

in order to match the defintion of the second principle $\text{d}S=\delta Q /T$.



## zeroth principle and equilibrium

## the principle zero of thermodynamics

## First principle 

$$ U = \langle E \rangle = \sum_i p_i E_i $$ 

$$\text{d} U = \sum_i E_i\text{d}p_i + \sum_i p_i \text{d}E_i $$

$$\boxed{\delta Q = \sum_i E_i\text{d}p_i }$$

$$\boxed{\delta W =  \sum_i p_i \text{d}E_i}$$

## Second principle



## Third principle
