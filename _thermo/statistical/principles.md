# The three principles of thermodynamics in a statistical context

With all the machinery of statistical physics, it becomes possible to prove, or further justify the three principles of classical thermodynamics

## A remark: the conservation of information

## zeroth principle and equilibrium

## the principle zero of thermodynamics

## First principle 

$$ U = \langle E \rangle = \sum_i p_i E_i $$ 

$$\text{d} U = \sum_i E_i\text{d}p_i + \sum_i p_i \text{d}E_i $$

## Second principle

## Third principle
