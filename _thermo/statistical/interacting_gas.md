Now that we understood well the ideal gas, we can study many different cases, simply by changing the microphysics of the particle, and hence the Hamiltonian function. We could for exemple consider a gas made of particles of different masses etc. A useful example is the case of interacting particles within the gas, which will be a more accurate model than the ideal gas when pressures are high enough or temperatures low enough.

$$H(\Gamma) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum^{3\mathcal{N}} p_i^2 + \sum_{n>m} U(|q^{(n)}-q^{(m)}|)$$
