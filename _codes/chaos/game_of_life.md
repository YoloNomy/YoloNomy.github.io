# Introduction

The game of life was invented in 1970 by the mathematician John Horton Conway. It is defined as a cellular automaton, to simplify (and because the author is not an expert on that domain), it's a system consisting of cells on a 2D grid with a discrete evolution that obey to some rules. In the game of life each cell can be in two different state : alive or dead.

# The rules
Each iteration the new system state will change for each cell depending of it's surrounding (the 8 cells arround it) and following these rules : 

* If an alive cell has less than 2 alive neighbours, she dies of loneliness 
* If an alive cell has 2 or 3 neighbours, she is happy and stay alive
* If an alive cell has more than 3 neighbours, she dies of pression
* If a dead cell is has 3 alive neighbours (mom, dad and the doctor), she became alive
