# Kepler laws

- law 1: trajectories
- law 2: areas
- law 3: $$T^2/a^3$$

# Why are they so important ?

# Examples

# Polar coordinates

# The cross product 

Consider two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$. 
$\vec{u} \times \vec{v}$ or $\vec{u} \wedge \vec{v}$.

# Newton and gravity

$$ \vec{F_G} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\vec{u_r}_ $$

# Proof of the second law

# Presenting the first law

# A warm-up: third law for spherical orbits

# General proof of the first law

# General proof of the third law
